 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • The app will have a single page, the detailing will be shown with a bottom drawer.
 • The bottom drawer will hold the places by giving respective space for information.
 • Not sure about a detail page implementation at this stage.
 • Tab bar is out of scope for now. But it would be nice.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • Had authentication problem due to legacy API, will continue with the suggested HERE API.
 • UI decisions are made.
 • Analyzing API to take advantage of its capabilities. Working on the postman collection.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • Up front did the Postman collection.
 • Started development.
 
 
 June - 16
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • Generally lost valuable time on insisting not to break the design choice but having top and
 bottom sheet implementation was not serving me.
 
 
 June - 17
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • Aborted top sheet implementation. UISearchController will be used as an alternative.
 • Started the network related development.
 • I am behind the schedule so i decided to just do the bare minimum, but if i have time left
 i want to do some features and improvements.
