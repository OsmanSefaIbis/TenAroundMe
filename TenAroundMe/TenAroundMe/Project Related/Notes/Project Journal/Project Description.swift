 Project Overview
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 • Create an application that allows the user to search (e.g. Cafe, Hotels, etc.) for the top 10 places closest to the user's current location.
 
 • The top 10 places should be displayed on a map with a pin.
 
 • Each pin should be tappable to display additional information such as the name and distance from the current location.
 
 • Use the https://places.demo.api.here.com/places/ API to get location data.
 
 Standout By
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 • Include unit tests that can be run to verify your application is working as expected.
 
 • Take the time to design a user interface that is easy to use but well rounded.
 
 • Also consider displaying additional information in the UI as well.
 
 • Include Core Data to persist location data.
 
 • Implement pre-caching to avoid blocking loading UI whenever possible.
 
 • Document your code!
 
 • Use github for version control.
 
 • Think outside of the box.
