 June - 13 --> 5 PM --> Case Given
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 
 • The design guidelines of prominent platforms such as TripAdvisor, Airbnb, and Foursquare
 were examined and analyzed to gather insights and inspiration for UI/UX ideation.
 
 • Before implementing the project, a detailed examination of the API was carried out to understand
 its capabilities. This investigation aimed to determine the scope of the API and how it could meet
 the project's requirements.
 
 • The app's user interface is designed using Figma to ensure a consistent and guided approach
 throughout the development process. Started today.
 
 • Started to gain familiarity with the MapKit SDK to effectively incorporate it into the project.
 At the moment do not know its capabilities, it will be a learning challange.
 
 • Applied a folder structure to ease the organizational debt.
 
 • Analyzed the development scope and made decisions to optimize time and progress in the project.
 Strategy is to meet the minimum requirements of the project then improving upon it with time.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 • Read the Guide and API reference, thought about what and how to use the API.
 
 • Did the postman collection to test the api capabilities, added to the project as a public link.
 
 • ❗️ Matt Austin --> Reached to me about the technical problem that i had with API key and API.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 • Started the implementation.
 
 • Joined to the Slack channel and asked about the API related problem. The API key does not authenticate requests for the demo places api.
 
 • After analyzing the HERE_Geocoding_Search_API_v7 decided to take the initiative to continue with it. Emailed HR no notify.
 
 • Added MVVM boilerplates.
 
 
 June - 17
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 • Added a custom implementation for the top sheet.

 • The design choices i made is causing efforts.
 
 • Search UI is added.
